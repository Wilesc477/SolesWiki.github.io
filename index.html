            The Kingdoms aside from ExcitedLand!! have had repeated wars over the past couple centuries (see [80 year
            war](events/80%year%war), [war of 1000](events/war%of%1000), [Red year](events/Red%year)), but are in a
            period of uneasy peace for the moment. The players begin
            their quest in west Soles, in the town of [Wehret](locations/Wehret).
